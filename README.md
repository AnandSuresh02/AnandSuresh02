<h1 align="center">Hi there 👋 I'm Anand!</h1>

### Disclaimer: These are just basic informations about me. I could be really different in real life. It could be good or bad, depending on your current impression about me XD.

<!--
**AnandSuresh02/AnandSuresh02** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Android**, **Flutter**, **C++**, **JS** and **BTech ECE** too.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Open-Source**.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with anything except your life problems that I can't deal with.
- 💬 Ask me about **Sci-FI** stuff. I really like those. **Interdimensional travel**, **Time travel**, **Black hole**s, **Big bang**, and even **Multiverse** XD.
- 📫 How to reach me: anandzzz360@gmail.com
